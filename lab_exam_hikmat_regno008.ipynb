funds worth up to $120m (\\u00e2\\u00a364m) went missing.\\n \\n the pair both worked at bank of china in the northern city of harbin, the south china morning post reported. the latest scandal at bank of china will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that china's big four banks are ready for international listings. government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. bank of china is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. the other is china construction bank. both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n they shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n however, a report in the china-published economic observer said on monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in new york because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the enron scandal. bank of china is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while china construction bank is the largest deposit holder. china's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. the most high-profile case involved the ex-president of bank of china, wang xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. although, he committed the offences whilst running bank of china in new york, mr wang was head of china construction bank when the scandal broke. earlier this month, a china construction bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n china's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. the introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. last year, china's premier, wen jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. china's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of china's economic boom. but two problems persist. first, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. another high profile financial firm, china life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the us securities and exchange commission following its 2004 new york listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"fast moving phone viruses appear\\n \\n security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.\\n \\n the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir.\\n \\n the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.\\n \\n however, the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian's series 60 software is licenced by nokia, lg electronics, lenovo, panasonic, samsung, sendo and siemens.\\n\",\n          \"henson stakes early lions claim\\n \\n the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.\\n \\n the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he's very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o'driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly-half.\\n \\n jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however, i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france.\\n \\n tom smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of chris cusiter, jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland's win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o'driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o'connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o'kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday, although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum-half after that.\\n\"\n        ],\n

valuing the premiership club at \\u00e2800m\\n \\n the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 281 shareholding to vote off three board members last november\\n \\n man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debtladen bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid\\n \\n meanwhile uniteds chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course\\n \\n to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 289 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sundays announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club\\n\",\n          \"souness eyes summer move for owen\\n \\n newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen\\n \\n he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision\\n \\n milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling\\n \\n the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now\\n\",\n          \"china net cafe culture crackdown\\n \\n chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n \\n according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n \\n the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n \\n net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

valuing the premiership club at \\u00e2800m\\n \\n the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 281 shareholding to vote off three board members last november\\n \\n man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debtladen bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid\\n \\n meanwhile uniteds chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course\\n \\n to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 289 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sundays announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club\\n\",\n          \"souness eyes summer move for owen\\n \\n newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen\\n \\n he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision\\n \\n milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling\\n \\n the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now\\n\",\n          \"china net cafe culture crackdown\\n \\n chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n \\n according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n \\n the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n \\n net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the

valuing the premiership club at \\u00e2800m\\n \\n the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 281 shareholding to vote off three board members last november\\n \\n man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debtladen bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid\\n \\n meanwhile uniteds chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course\\n \\n to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 289 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sundays announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club\\n\",\n          \"souness eyes summer move for owen\\n \\n newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen\\n \\n he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision\\n \\n milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling\\n \\n the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now\\n\",\n          \"china net cafe culture crackdown\\n \\n chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n \\n according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n \\n the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n \\n net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

valuing the premiership club at \\u00e2800m\\n \\n the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 281 shareholding to vote off three board members last november\\n \\n man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debtladen bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid\\n \\n meanwhile uniteds chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course\\n \\n to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 289 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sundays announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club\\n\",\n          \"souness eyes summer move for owen\\n \\n newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen\\n \\n he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision\\n \\n milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling\\n \\n the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now\\n\",\n          \"china net cafe culture crackdown\\n \\n chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n \\n according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n \\n the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n \\n net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
